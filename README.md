# Point Cloud Study - PCL

A little about:

Small set of programs and tests on point cloud processing. For each project there is the run.sh file where you specify what is required to run the program. Because point cloud is large these files will not be available.

### Libraries used:

 * [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/) for point cloud processing
 * [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/) for compilation
 * [Guides Github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for create this readme
